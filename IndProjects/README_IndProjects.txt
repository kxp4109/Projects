Folder for assorted elements from various projects I'm working on.
Nothing in a visual state as of now since Combo Breaker's current rehash.
Current projects: 
  Combo Breaker - currently undergoing a redesign,  designed to be a deckbuilder which emulates 2D fighter games using a combo system.

  Flight sim using the small fighters from the 3D Autonomous Agents.  Movement controlled with independent thrusts from each rocket.
  Emu war based board game: An asymetrical experience where one player controls the Emus and 1-4 other players plays as the Australians.
  
Will be subject to rapid changes and projects getting added/dropped/removed.
