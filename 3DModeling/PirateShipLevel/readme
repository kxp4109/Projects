The Web Build relies on the Unity Plugin, currently only able to run in Firefox.
To run it, download both files in the web build and open the HTML file using Firefox.
The basic project build is too large.  It is available on request until I find an alternative hosting solution.
However, the screenshot folder shows instances of the level in action as an alternative.
I apologize for any inconvenience.
