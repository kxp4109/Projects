# Works

A collection of my (Robert Bailey) coding and modelling works.

Currently, anything created is done with software made under educational licenses at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
For most, this isn't a big deal, but for the Maya software and Unity projects, it's important to note.  

Do not use for commercial works.
